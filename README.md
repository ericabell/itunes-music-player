# Really Awesome Music player

I have implemented both the plain iTunes API version of this project as well
as a version that allows the user to auth with Spotify to give access to
better album artwork, etc.

I have two branches to access these versions, as explained below.

I have also managed the project in waffle.io, link below.

Branches:
=========
master: the plain vanilla version of the project with a static index.html

add-express-server: uses express and gives the user an option to auth with Spotify
